# Nearby - Android Application

This is an Android application developed in Kotlin, designed to discover nearby places, connect with local communities, and get some coupons.

This repo was created to start studying Kotlin. In this project, I learned how to create an Android app with Compose, some basic features about Kotlin syntax, and how to connect a project with the Google Maps API.
